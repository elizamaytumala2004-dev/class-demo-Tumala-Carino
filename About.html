                <p>
                    The School Management System was made to help the departments of Pasig Catholic College
                    plan, approve, and keep track of things in a more organized and easier way. It serves as a
                    one-stop platform where departments can submit their event proposals, include activity
                    details and budgets, and check the status of their approval all in one place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system helps improve coordination among college departments, ensuring that every event
                    is properly planned, scheduled, and budgeted. By going digital, it minimizes manual mistakes
                    and promotes a more transparent and efficient approval process.
